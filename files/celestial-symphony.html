        <h1>Celestial Symphony: The Stars</h1>
        <p>
            Stars are the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. They shine by converting hydrogen into helium in their cores
            through nuclear fusion, a process that powers them and creates light. There are billions of stars, each at different
            stages of their life cycle, and they can vary greatly in size, brightness, and temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
            The life of a star is determined by its mass. More massive stars burn brighter but live shorter lives, while smaller
            stars can burn for billions of years. Our own Sun is a relatively small star, which has been burning for about 4.6
            billion years and is expected to continue for another 5 billion years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stars are also classified by their color, which is determined by their temperature. Blue stars are the hottest,
            followed by white, yellow, orange, and red stars, which are cooler. The color and brightness of a star tell us
            a great deal about its age, size, and distance from Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stars play a central role in the evolution of galaxies and in the formation of planets, making them crucial for
            understanding the universe and our place within it.
